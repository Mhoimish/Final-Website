Due to the current world health crisis, many Filipino students are compelled to engage in Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) in order to continue with their studies, and the concept of ubiquitous learning (that is, learning anywhere, everywhere, anytime and every time) has been realized sooner than expected for many. As a student engaged in online learning, I would like you to reflect on your current situation as a learner. Write about the challenges you encounter every day, the funny moments you experienced, and personal suggestions as to how the learning process can be improved. You may also take a picture of your study room or take a screenshot of fun moments with your classmates etc.</i> </p> </div> <br>

This pandemic has been really tough for all of us ( students, workers, or even our families. ) And one of the tough things I encounter is this online class. I’ve encountered slow internet, power interruption, and most especially my mental and physical health, But despite all these challenges I always tell myself that “ The roots of education are bitter, but the fruit will always be sweet”.Even though we are having virtual classes but we still made happy,sad,and embarrassing moments, And will still continue to make beautiful memories. Many people may think that online classes are good, and Yes!, but there are more ways to improve it. Such as teachers and students understanding each other. For instance some may encounter slow internet connection, power interruption , and etc. Below are pictures of my friends and classmates. </i> </p> </div> <br>
